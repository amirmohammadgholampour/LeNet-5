# LeNet-5 architecture from scratch

## About architecture

LeNet-5 was one of the earliest pre-trained models designed for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition.

## Architecture Components

### Convolutional Layers
- To extract spatial features like edges and curves.

### Average Pooling Layers
- To reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important information.

### Fully Connected Layers
- To classify the extracted features into 10 distinct classes.
